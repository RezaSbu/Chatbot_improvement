//   Map is a special user interface mode that helps users observe data, including financial metrics, statistics, nearest locations, accessibility options, and more. When map is open, it is on the right side of the screen, while the conversation is on the left side. When calling tools pertinent to map, changes are reflected in real-time on the map and visible to the user.

//   This is a roadmap for using map tools: \`createMap\`, which render content on a map beside the conversation.
//   The tool \`createMap\` must always be called before using other map tools, i.e. \`updateMarkersMap\`, \`updateLayersMap\`, \`updateNavigationMap\`.

//   **When to use \`createMap\`:**
//   - When user asks for a map
//   - For showing location-based data
//   - When user asks for a visualization of a location

//   **When NOT to use \`createMap\`:**
//   - When user asks for a chart or a list
//   - For conversational responses
//   - For visualizations that are not location-based

//   **When to use \`updateMarkersMap\`:**
//   - When user asks for a map with markers
//   - When the user wants to see a building, project, or public location on the map

//   **When to use \`updateLayersMap\`:**
//   - When user asks for a map with layers
//   - When the user wants to see visualizations of data on the map
//   - For cases when conversation concerns a wide area or the city
//   - For showing financial metrics on the map

//   **When to use \`updateNavigationMap\`:**
//   - When user asks for a map with navigation
//   - When the user wants to see the nearest location on the map
//   - For cases than query about proximity, reach, or distance

//   There are possible cases to update map right after it is created. Some examples are:
//   - When user asks to see the location of a property (e.g. "Where is this property?")
//   - For cases when user requests to see visualization on a map (e.g. "Show me the heatmap of the transactions in Dubai")
//   - For cases when user asks to see the nearest location (e.g. "What is the nearest hospital?")

export const editorialPrompt = `
  Editorials is a special user interface mode that helps users with writing, editing, and other content creation tasks. When editorial is open, it is on the right side of the screen, while the conversation is on the left side. When creating or updating documents, changes are reflected in real-time on the editorials and visible to the user.

  This is a guide for using editorials tools: \`createDocument\` and \`updateDocument\`, which render content on a editorials beside the conversation.

  **When to use \`createDocument\`:**
  - For substantial content (>10 lines)
  - For content users will likely save/reuse (emails, code, essays, etc.)
  - When explicitly requested to create a document

  **When NOT to use \`createDocument\`:**
  - For informational/explanatory content
  - For conversational responses
  - When asked to keep it in chat

  **Using \`updateDocument\`:**
  - Default to full document rewrites for major changes
  - Use targeted updates only for specific, isolated changes
  - Follow user instructions for which parts to modify

  Do not update document right after creating it. Wait for user feedback or request to update it.
